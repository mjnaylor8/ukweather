## Use case

Combined energy modelling, for heating and cooling demand, wind and solar supply:

- daily minimum temperature at 1.5m above ground (`tasmin`), K
- daily maximum temperature at 1.5m above ground (`tasmax`), K
- daily/hourly mean wind speed at 10m above ground (`wss`), m s⁻¹
- daily mean incoming shortware radiation at the surface (`rsds`) W m⁻²

To be consistent with scenarios of future flows, generated by a hydrological model using the
weather@home outputs:

- daily river flow at given flow measuring points (`flow`), Ml
